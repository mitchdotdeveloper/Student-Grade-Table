<details>
<summary>1. Where to Begin </summary>

  - Note the information presented in the included `script.js` file
    - READ THE COMMENTS!!! (excuse the yelling, but reading the documentation will be essential to completing this project, so start off on the right foot!)
  - Now, move on to the `student.js` file
    - Read through the comments in the file
        - familiarize yourself with the structure of the object, the methods it contains, and the data it will receive
    - Now that you are familiar with your environment
        - Begin working in the `getData` method
            - The instructions above the method will describe the functionality
            - When you are complete with this method, move on to the `render` method
        - As with the `getData` method, the instructions above the `render` method will tell you the required functionality
        - To test your work:
            - Run the application
                - Note the errors that are displayed at the bottom of the screen
                - This is the tester display, it will contain information you need to figure out the next piece of functionality that must be completed
            - Also, make sure your dev tools are ALWAYS OPEN (sorry for yelling again, but unless your inspector is open, your aren't developing, your guessing)
                - The above is true, keep the inspector open
            - During your building process:
              - Make sure to clarify instructions if you don't know what you are being asked
              - Remember that you can do it!!!
    - Once you have passed all of the student tests, congratulations, you are ready to move on to the SGT object in the next feature set!

### After Each Feature

- When your feature implementation is complete, you will want to save and submit your work to the branch that you have created.
  - Use `git status` to check that you are on the correct branch that represents your feature.
  - You will want to **add**, **commit**, and **push** the code that you have written to the appropriate Github repository.
    1. `git add .`
    2. `git commit -m "Description of the feature that you have implemented"`
       - e.g. `git commit -m "completed initial build of student object"`
    3. `git push origin FEATURE_NAME_HERE`
       - e.g. `git push origin student-object`

- Finally, you will want to create a pull request. This will merge the code from your newly **completed** feature branch into your `master` branch.
