### After Each Feature

- When your feature implementation is complete, you will want to save and submit your work to the branch that you have created.
  - Use `git status` to check that you are on the correct branch that represents your feature.
  - You will want to **add**, **commit**, and **push** the code that you have written to the appropriate Github repository.
    1. `git add .`
    2. `git commit -m "Description of the feature that you have implemented"`
       - e.g. `git commit -m "completed initial build of SGT object"`
    3. `git push origin FEATURE_NAME_HERE`
       - e.g. `git push origin sgt-object`

- Finally, you will want to create a pull request. This will merge the code from your newly **completed** feature branch into your `master` branch.
