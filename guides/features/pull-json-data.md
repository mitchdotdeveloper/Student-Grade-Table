Instructions - Pulling JSON Data
--

### Overview

In this feature, you will add the functionality of being able to pull student data from an external file. This will be the first step in understanding how to make a request to a file on your local filesystem. When complete with this functionality, you will modify this request to be made to get data from an external webserver.

### After Each Feature

- When your feature implementation is complete, you will want to save and submit your work to the branch that you have created.
  - Use `git status` to check that you are on the correct branch that represents your feature.
  - You will want to **add**, **commit**, and **push** the code that you have written to the appropriate Github repository.
    1. `git add .`
    2. `git commit -m "Description of the feature that you have implemented"`
       - e.g. `git commit -m "added base calculation functionality"`
    3. `git push origin FEATURE_NAME_HERE`
       - e.g. `git push origin basic-calculation`

- Finally, you will want to create a pull request. This will merge the code from your newly **completed** feature branch into your `master` branch.
